=head1 NAME

Acme::Free::API::Stonks - Perl API client for the, I<top 50 stocks discussed on le'Reddit
subeddit - r/Wallstreetbets>, L<https://tradestie.com/apps/reddit/api/>.

This module provides the client, "stonks", that is available via C<PATH> after install.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  #!/usr/bin/env perl
  
  use strict;
  use warnings;
  
  use Acme::Free::API::Stonks qw//;
  
  my $stonk = Acme::Free::API::Stonks->new;
  
  printf STDERR "%-5s %-8s %-4s %4s\n", "tick", "sentiment", "score", "comments"; 
  foreach my $s (sort {$a->ticker cmp $b->ticker} $stonk->stonks->all) {
    printf "%-5s %-8s % 4.3f % 4d\n", $s->ticker // "na", $s->sentiment // "na", $s->sentiment_score // "nan", $s->no_of_comments // "nan";
  }

=head2 C<stonks> Commandline Client

After installing this module, simply run the command C<stonks> without any arguments, and it
will print a 4-column list of the top 50 stocks discussed on Reddit subeddit, C<r/Wallstreetbets>.

The example below is printing out the full list (at the time of this writing), sorting by the
4th column using C<sort> (this is the proper way to do it on the cli).

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This fun module is to demonstrate how to use L<Util::H2O::More> to make
API SaaS modules and clients in a clean and idiomatic way. These kind of
APIs tracked at L<https://www.freepublicapis.com/> are really nice for
fun and practice because they don't require dealing with API keys in the
vast majority of cases. In some cases, the are actually useful.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item C<new>

Instantiates object reference. No parameters are accepted.

=item C<stonks>

Object method that returns an ARRAY reference (based on the JSON returned
by this service), that's been give the additional ARRAY vmethods via
L<Util::H2O::More> such as C<< ->all >> (used in the L<SYNOPSIS> above).

=back

=head2 Internal Methods

=over 4

=item C<get>

Called internally by C<quote>. This method uses L<HTTP::Tiny> to call to the API.
Then L<Util::H2O::More>'s C<d2o> is used to deal with the resulting respons that has
an accessor called C<quote>. This is what's invoked that returns the actual ARRAY
refernce of stonks records (HASH refs).

Nothing special required.
